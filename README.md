Founders: Brandon Krieg left Ed Robinson Right.  
     (Founded Feb 2015) 

* Idea of the company came about because these two New York Wall Street workers wanted to help change the lives of millions of people in America who are being under served by financial institutions and services.

* Stash has raised **$302.4M** in funding 9 rounds to be exact. April 29, 2020 was there last funding round **Series F**.


 




## Business Activities:

* The companiees main users are 18-34 years old Americans , avreage age 29 which is **80%** of there business and the market cap is **75 million**. Solutions include : making Stash just **$5** to start investing; it takes 5 mins to sign up. Built in learning mechanism ( Stash Learn) to help users become more financialy literate, teaches users how to invest over time and (Stash Advisor) stays with users to help guides with and tips. (Auto-Stash) helps users become consistant investors.  Users will understand what (dollar cost average) which is a very impartant invetment skill. 
 

* Heroku is the main sofware which helps with server management, and gives more time for product development. 
APEX clearing helps settle and clear trades. 
Major partnership with a digital bank (Green Dot) this helped them have the options of accounts and debit cards.




## Landscape:
 * Stahs's Domain is Personal Finance, Deposits, OnlineBank,Investing, InsurTech. Stash has there hand in a lot of domains. The major trends that has been occuring in these domains are efficient access to these financial products. Stash has created a plateform that houses pretty much every financial product you can think of, and it's goal is to continue to expand it's services. Some of the the major competiters in this space are RobinHood, Acorn, YieldStreet,Kabbage, Revolut.
 
 What made Stash different from all the other competitors was when the company offered acccounts and debit cards they also created (Stock Back). With every daily purchase users can collect fractions of stocks of there favorite brands by just shopping.
  
  
  
  
  ## Results 
 * Stash has had a major impact on how investing is done. They have been able to force the hands of major banks & brokers like (Vanguardd, Fidelity & CharlesScwhab) to cancel transaction fees for the user and become more transparent to the masses.
 
*  The company measures it's success by how many users have accounts open on there platform. Right now 4.5 million user and $1 billion in assets are under management.  Stash is holding it's own against there competitors, if not better. Stash continues to push the bouderies on inovation. 




## Recommendation
* Some adivise that would help expanand the company is getting into cc cards and lending. Other companies in the same space have not thought of lending or cc cards, and they don't offer options like Stash does. The CC expantion would be a great add to the product line  becasue it will lock in the younger generation and future borrowers.
 
    The partnership between greendot and Stash would need to grow to be able to impliment the cc product. The card would have to be comaptible with apple wallet and android wallet so you won't necessarily need to hold the card with you.
